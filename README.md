## Description
Will be a website to view algorithms. Only have Bubble sort at the moment. Next algorithms to be added located in [Roadmap](#Roadmap)
Possible plans to view in different deviations such as sorted, unsorted. Currently uses an algorithm to generate random numbers using a normal distribution.


## Roadmap
- Quick Sort
- Insertion Sort
- Merge Sort
- Dijkstra's Algorithm
- Prim's Algorithm
- Knapsack Algorithm
